# Fractal Shapes
Fun with Fractal Shapes on OpenGL!

This is a program that shows 5 different scenes, each with its own fractal shape. Number of iterations of the fractal shapes can be changed up and down, with certain limits.

## Controls:
Each part of the assignment had a number key for each scene - 0 through 4.

Key 0: Sierpinski Triangle

Key 1: Uniform Triangle Mass Center

Key 2: Kock Snowflake

Key 3: Dragon Curve

Key 4: Hilbert Curve

For changing iterations use the left and right arrow keys. Iterations go from 0 to 9.

Left Arrow: Down 1 iteration

Right Arrow: Up 1 iteration

This code was written and compiled in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 on a PC running Windows 11

## Running Code:
Open the 453-skeleton.exe file in \FractalShapes\out\build\x64-Debug folderpath

By default the program starts on scene 0 (Sierpinski Triangle) and with no iterations.

If you change scenes it'll keep the iteration of the previous scene.
