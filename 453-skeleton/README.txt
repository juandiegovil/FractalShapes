This code was written and compiled in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 on a PC running Windows 11

To run this code simply add the main.cpp source file to the 453-skeleton folder with the other source files:
	\453-skeleton-updated\453-skeleton-updated\453-skeleton
Then open the 453-skeleton.exe file in the following folder path:
	\453-skeleton-updated Assignment 1\453-skeleton-updated\out\build\x64-Debug

By default the program starts on scene 0 (Sierpinski Triangle) and with no iterations.
If you change scenes it'll keep the iteration of the previous scene.
